## dimensions
Dimension standard names may come in sets of six related standard names for each dimension:
```
[dim_name]_dimension -- The full dimension size
[dim_name]_loop_extent -- Size of dim for current call
[dim_name]_begin - Start index for dimension
[dim_name]_end - End index for dimension
[dim_name]_index - Single index for dimension
[dim_name]_selection - Array of selected indices for dimension
```
Note that the cap generator may substitute among standard names in this category in order to properly call suite parts and individual schemes. In the substitutions below, the name on the left is the standard_name in the dimensions field of the caller while the name(s) on the right is (are) the standard name(s) of the callee (in the form used in the subroutine call).
```
[dim_name]_dimension ==> 1:[dim_name]_loop_extent
[dim_name]_loop_extent ==> 1:[dim_name]_loop_extent
[dim_name]_begin:[dim_name]_end ==> 1:[dim_name]_loop_extent
[dim_name]_begin:[dim_name]_end ==> 1:[dim_name]_dimension
```
Also note that horizontal_dimension should be used in xxx_[timestep_]init and xxx_[timestep_]final routines but not in xxx_run routines.
